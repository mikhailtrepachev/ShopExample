This project was created specifically for portfolios and for testing the different features of frameworks. 
I implemented some features in this project differently than I would have if I had worked on a real project (e.g. I would have implemented image uploading using AWS S3 or for databases 
I would have used message brokers for example).

About the project:

This project is a bulletin board designed for the sale of automobiles. Currently implemented admin panel, basic functionality for creating ads and viewing them.

Technologies used: ASP.NET, Entity Framework, IdentityServer, MediatR, Reinforced Typings, Angular, rxjs, Bootstrap, primeng, MS-SQL as the database

The server part is based on the Clean Architecture, the client application is divided into modules and components. The facade pattern is also used.


TODO:
- Cover the application with tests
- Visual design rework
- Section with personal promotional offers
